You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given /^I am logged in with username "([^"]*)" and password "([^"]*)"$/ do |arg1, arg2|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end

Given /^joe's interests include "([^"]*)"$/ do |arg1|

end

Then /^I should see that joe's interests include "([^"]*)"$/ do |arg1|
  pending # express the regexp above with the code you wish you had
end
