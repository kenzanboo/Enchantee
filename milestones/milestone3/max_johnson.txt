I also looked at the code for the whiteboard project. I was particularly impressed by the AJAX-powered mouse drawing. To implement it they do an AJAX request for every mouse action, and then store them into the database so they can be recreated later. All together it looks pretty sophisticated, especially the relatively attractive UI (at least compared to ours, but that will improve).
