I found the whiteboard project particularly interesting. The particularly interesting point is how they are able update the board with mouse information and be able to drag and draw free lines onto the surface without any refreshes. Looking into their code, it seems like all the coordinate information for the mouse movement is stored into a data field. It seems like for each mouse line, it creates a new row in the database. Each point of data has all the information stored in the layer. Also their CSS and formatting is very pretty.
